# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- **Agent Skills–compatible environment** (e.g. [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com))
- **Jira** – Active account with API access
- **GitHub** – Account with personal access token

---

## Step 1: Configure MCP

**MCP combination:** GitHub + Jira — GitHub for repos/PRs, Jira for issue tracking.

[Full MCP setup →](reference/mcp-setup.md).

Open your environment’s MCP settings (e.g. **Cursor:** Settings → Features → Model Context Protocol) and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "atlassian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Get GitHub Token:**

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` and `read:org`
4. Copy token into config above

**Authorize Atlassian:**

First time you use Jira, your environment may prompt for OAuth (e.g. Cursor prompts for Atlassian authorization).

## Step 2: Install Skills

SDLC Workflow Skills uses the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format. The same **`skills/`** layout and **`SKILL.md`** files work for **Cursor**, **Claude**, and **Codex**—each environment loads from its own skills directory (see table below). We recommend installing with the **npx skills** CLI; Cursor users can alternatively install from GitHub or copy from a release.

| Environment | Project-level | User-level (global) |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Cursor**  | `.cursor/skills/`  | `~/.cursor/skills/`  |
| **Claude**  | `.claude/skills/`  | `~/.claude/skills/`  |
| **Codex**   | `.codex/skills/`   | `~/.codex/skills/`   |

Choose one of the following.

### Option A (recommended): Install with npx skills

The [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs skills for Cursor, Claude, Codex, and other agents. Discover skills at [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

**Cursor:**

```bash
npx skills add fancy-bread/sdlc-workflow-skills -a cursor
```

When the CLI asks **Symlink** or **Copy**, choose **Copy**. Cursor does not reliably list or load skills when `~/.cursor/skills` is a symlink; using Copy avoids this.

For other agents or global install, see [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) and [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

**Layout (Cursor, Claude, Codex)**

The same layout works for all three: a top-level **`skills/`** directory; each skill is a subfolder containing **`SKILL.md`** with YAML frontmatter **`name`** (matching the folder name) and **`description`**. See [Cursor: Agent Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills#skillmd-file-format), [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io), and [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

To verify the install: open your agent chat and type `/`—you should see the SDLC commands (e.g. `/start-task`, `/complete-task`).

### Option B: Download release and copy

Skills live in **`skills/`** (in the repo or in the release archive). Copy them into your environment’s skills directory.

[**Full installation details →**](releases.md#installation)

**Summary:**

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](releases.md)
2. Extract the archive
3. Copy `skills/*` to your environment’s skills directory (see table above: Cursor `.cursor/skills/` or `~/.cursor/skills/`, Claude `.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`, Codex `.codex/skills/` or `~/.codex/skills/`). **Cursor Team/Enterprise:** Use Dashboard → Team Content → Skills to create team skills from `skills/`; they sync to your team.
4. Restart your IDE or agent

---

## Step 3: Run Your First Skill

Open your agent chat (e.g. **Cursor:** `Cmd/Ctrl + L`) and run:

```
/start-task PROJ-123
```

AI will:

1. Read the command instruction
2. Verify MCP connections and check for a spec, plan, or acceptance criteria
3. Create the feature branch and begin implementation

**That's it!** You're using agentic skills.

## Try a Development Workflow

```bash
# Build
/start-task PROJ-123

# Ship
/complete-task PROJ-123
```

---

## How It Works

**AI agents handle routine tasks:**

- Story and epic creation
- Implementation planning
- Branch and PR creation
- Test generation
- Issue updates

**You control decisions:**

- Plan approval
- Code review
- Work selection
- Architecture

**Full transparency:**

- Specs in `specs/` folder (permanent feature contracts)
- Plans in `.plans/` folder (transient task implementation)
- PRs link to stories
- Commits include story IDs
