   - Parse acceptance criteria
   - Identify technical requirements

2. **Analyze codebase**
   - Understand existing architecture
   - Identify affected components
   - Find similar implementations
   - Review patterns and conventions

3. **Design implementation**
   - Break down into subtasks
   - Identify files to create/modify

   - Include file-by-file changes
   - Document test approach
   - Add verification checklist
   - Post plan summary to issue
