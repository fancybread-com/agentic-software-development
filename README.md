## What This Is

SDLC Workflow Skills provides [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) that implement [ASDLC](https://asdlc.io/) workflows. They work in any environment that supports Agent Skills and across teams and projects.

Built on ASDLC principles: Factory Architecture (specialized command stations), Standardized Parts (schema-enforced structure), and Quality Control (automated gates). See [ASDLC Alignment](https://fancy-bread.github.io/sdlc-workflow-skills/reference/asdlc-alignment/) for pattern mapping.

**Built on:**
- **Agent Skills** – Markdown instructions with frontmatter (supported by Cursor and other Agent Skills–compatible environments)
- **MCP** – Jira, GitHub
- **Cursor IDE** – Primary tested environment; others may work where the format is supported

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure MCP

Configure MCP in your IDE or agent (e.g. **Cursor:** Settings → Features → Model Context Protocol). Example for **GitHub + Jira**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "atlassian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

GitHub token: [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (scopes: `repo`, `read:org`). Jira: your environment will prompt for Atlassian OAuth on first use. [Full MCP setup →](https://fancy-bread.github.io/sdlc-workflow-skills/reference/mcp-setup/)

### 2. Install Skills

**Recommended:** Install with the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) (Cursor, Claude, Codex):

```bash
npx skills add fancy-bread/sdlc-workflow-skills -a cursor
```

Choose **Copy** when prompted (symlinks can prevent Cursor from listing skills).

**Or** copy the repo's `skills/` folder into your environment's skills directory:

| Environment | User-level | Project-level |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Cursor**  | `~/.cursor/skills/`  | `.cursor/skills/`  |
| **Claude**  | `~/.claude/skills/`  | `.claude/skills/`  |
| **Codex**   | `~/.codex/skills/`   | `.codex/skills/`   |

**Or** use a [packaged release](https://github.com/fancy-bread/sdlc-workflow-skills/releases): download the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` for the latest version, extract it, and copy the `skills/` folder into your environment's directory (see table above).

### 3. Use Skills (slash commands)

```
/start-task PROJ-123
/complete-task PROJ-123
```

## How It Works

Skills connect you to AI agents that interact with Jira, GitHub, and your codebase. The AI reads your project context and executes workflows consistently across projects.
